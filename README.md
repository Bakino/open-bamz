# Open BamZ developper installation guide

These instruction are for the developpers that want to contribute to Open BamZ itself.

The Open BamZ code base is delivered with devcontainer settings. As a requirement, install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [devcontainer extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

Prepare 2 docker volume : 
```
docker volume create dev-open-bamz-db
docker volume create dev-open-bamz-data
```

Clone the repository and open it in VSCode, VSCode will suggest to "Reopen in container", click on the button to reopen the folder in the container

ðŸ‘‰ What should I do if I don't want to use VSCode or devcontainer ? We suggest to use the devcontainer to ensure the Node.js and PostgreSQL version and run in a clean environnement but there nothing much more about it so you can just install a local Node.js and PostgreSQL and run it directly without devcontainer. You can look at expected version in Dockerfiles and docker-compose, as well as the environnment variable that are expected to connect to the database
